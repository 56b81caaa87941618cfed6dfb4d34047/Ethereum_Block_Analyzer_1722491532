    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What is Ethereum block analysis?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "Ethereum block analysis involves parsing and inspecting new blocks as they are added to the Ethereum blockchain. This allows tracking transactions, smart contract deployments and interactions, and monitoring network activity in real-time.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "Why is block analysis important?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "Analyzing new Ethereum blocks provides valuable insights into on-chain activity, allowing developers to build innovative applications, auditors to monitor transactions, and researchers to study network dynamics. It enables timely detection of events of interest.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "How does your app perform block analysis?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "Our app connects to Ethereum nodes and efficiently parses new blocks as they are mined. It decodes transactions, logs, and traces blockchain state changes. Advanced filtering and notification tools allow focusing on specific events or addresses.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "What can I do with the analysis data?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "The analyzed block data can be used to trigger alerts, populate databases and analytics dashboards, drive automated smart contract interactions, audit transactions, and build novel blockchain monitoring and analysis tools.",

    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_1": "What is Ethereum block analysis?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_1": "Ethereum block analysis involves examining and interpreting data from newly mined blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. This provides insights into transaction activity, smart contract executions, and network dynamics.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_2": "Why is Ethereum block analysis important?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_2": "Analyzing new Ethereum blocks allows developers, businesses, and researchers to monitor the Ethereum network, track specific smart contracts or addresses, detect anomalies, and gain a deeper understanding of on-chain activity.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_3": "What data is included in Ethereum block analysis?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_3": "Ethereum block analysis typically covers details like block number, timestamp, miner information, transaction counts, gas usage, smart contract events, and any transfers of ETH or ERC-20 tokens.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_4": "How can I get started with Ethereum block analysis?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_4": "To analyze Ethereum blocks, you can use block explorers, nodes with JSON-RPC support, or dedicated analysis tools and APIs that parse and index blockchain data. Familiarity with Ethereum concepts and some coding skills are helpful.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_5": "Are there any limitations to Ethereum block analysis?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_5": "While valuable, Ethereum block analysis only covers on-chain data visible on the public blockchain. It does not reveal details about off-chain operations, intent behind transactions, or activities on private Ethereum networks.",
